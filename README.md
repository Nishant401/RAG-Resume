# RAG-Resume
FAQ Bot is a Streamlit-based RAG application that lets users upload PDFs and ask questions in natural language. It chunks documents, stores embeddings in ChromaDB, retrieves relevant context via semantic search, and uses Gemini to generate accurate answers, with real-time token usage tracking.
